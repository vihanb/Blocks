# Blocks
A language designed for matrix manipulation

[**WIKI ARTICLE**](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Unnamed)

**Note:** This language is also called "Unnamed", what happend is I forgot I named this language so I called it "Unnamed" and it kinda stuck

**Another NOTE:** Blocks will be rewritten soon with ES6 (and ES5), I've already started on this.

## Documentation

The shorthand is a shorter alternative to the command name so Blocks could be sutible for code-golfing.

Command | Shorthand |Description
--------|-----------|-----------
Set     |    ""     | Sets specified range with value
NSet    |    "n"    | Sets everything *except* within range with value
Expand  |    "U"    | Expands the matrix to a specified size size

To-be added:
